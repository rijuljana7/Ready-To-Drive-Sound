# Ready-To-Drive-Sound
Ready to Drive Sound is a characteristic sound that the vehicle makes when it is ready to drive. The circuitry of the RTDS combined
with its code in Arduino makes the buzzer audible for the duration of 2-3 seconds. The RTDS will be
activated whenever RTD mode is activated(i.e pressing of the start button along with actuation of brakes).The
circuit uses a NPN transistor to connect the buzzer to Arduino. The transistor allows the buzzer to be
powered from a different voltage to the Arduino.
